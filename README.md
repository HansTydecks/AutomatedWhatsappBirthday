# AutomatedWhatsappBirthday
This short program automates sending birthday messages to friends and family.
All the information regarding your personal contacts may easily be edited using the .txt file provided.
Make sure the BIRTHDAY_LIST.txt shares the same folders as the program (or change the direction within the code if necessary).
To personalize anything:
  1. Open BIRTHDAY_LIST.txt
  2. #{number} are the messages. Edit these to personalize any message that will be sent. If you want to add more messages, you may do so by adding #{some integer} to the list. MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE RANDOM NUMBER IN LINE 27 to reflect your changes
  3. Add contacts as such: {month},{day},{phonenumber},{name} (do not use spaces)
  4. Always make sure to safe the .txt
